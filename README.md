# MLBscraper

This repository uses the beautiful soup library to scrape the  mlb website for the latest statistics. 

# Getting Started

Clone a copy of MLBscraper onto your machine and
cd into that directory.

First you need to run:
pip install beautifulsoup4 
pip install requests

in that project directory.

Next, run python3 mlbscraper.py and enjoy your
structured data :)

# Future Plans

1. Automatically scrape the site on a weekly basis
2. Make a web app for sending alerts if a player is 
	beginning a hit streak. 
3. Plot the stat history of each player.
